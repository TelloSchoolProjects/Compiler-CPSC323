## **1) Problem Statement**

>The first assignment is to write a lexical analyzer (lexer).You can build your entire lexer using a FSM, Or build using at least FSMs for identifier, integer and real (the rest can be written ad-hoc)  but YOU HAVE TO CONSTRUCT A FSM for this assignment otherwise, there will be a deduction of 2 points!  

---

### **Note:** 
>In your documentation (design section), YOU MUST write the REs for Identifiers, Real and Integer, and also show the NFSM using Thompson.

- The lexerA major component of your assignment will be to write a procedure (Function) â€“ lexer (),  that returns a  token when it is needed.  
- Your lexer()  should return a record, one field for the token and another field the actual "value" of the token (lexeme), i.e. the instance of a token.
- Your main program should test the lexer i.e., your program should read a file containing the source code of Rat21F to generate tokens and write out the results to an output file.   
- Make sure that you print both, the tokens and lexemes. Basically, your main program should work as follows     
  ```while not finished (i.e. not end of the source file) do          call the lexer for a token          print the token and lexeme     endwhile```  
  
- Do at least 3 test cases and make sure that you turn in proper documentation using the documentation template.

## A simple  test case                    


### **(Partial) Source code:**  

  
 ``` while  (fahr <= upper)   a = 23.00;  /* this is sample */ ```  
   
**Output:**

|token               |             lexeme  |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
|keyword|                            while| 
|separator|                           (      |
|identifier|                           fahr| 
|operator           |                  <=     | 
|identifier        |                   upper |   
|separator |                           )|   
|identifier|                           a   |
|operator|                             =    |
|real|                                23.00  | 
|Separator|                            ;|
